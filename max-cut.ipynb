    "## QAOA (Max-Cut problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>During my study, I found two excellent references [6,7]</b> to get induced by MaxCut and QAOA in general. Under the section III \"III. QUANTUM APPROXIMATE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM (QAOA)\", subsection A. \"The overview of QAOA\" in the article from Choi and Kim [6] provides a didactic breakdown for QAOA. Incidentally, the breakdown proves to be crucial possession for destructing the MaxCut problem. Next, the article by Wang and Abdullah [7] provides insightful run over not only the algorithms but the circuits implementations too. <b>I firmly recommend you to read these two references.</b> Finally, the primary reference I used to produce this notebook is a Bachelor's thesis [8]. \n",

    "Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the flavor out of a collection termed as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA). QAOA is an approximation algorithm, that means it does not deliver the ‘best’ result, but only the ‘good enough’ result. How good of the result is quantified by a lower bound named approximation ratio. It runs on NISQ desvices and are promising candidate for asserting the so-called \"Quantum Supremacy\" [3]. Farhi, E. et al.[2] introduced the algorithm, in their work they solved the Max-Cut problem. They went ahead to provided the approximation ratio for \"3-Regular Graphs\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity is a glaring presence in VQAs. So it is for QAOA, being an element of it. A variational algorithm comprises several modular components that can be readily combined, extended and improved with developments in quantum hardware and algorithms. The parts are, Objective function, Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC), Measurement and Parameter Optimization [1]. The last one is the only classical moving part to seek the best combination of parameter that maximizes the Objective function. Hence, the VQAs are dubbed as \"Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms\" [4]. Another perspective to bear in mind for Max-Cut problem is Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). This is a problem in mathematics and can be solved within it's domain. Read more about QUBO here [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "To paraphrase the choi, et al. [6], the QAOA can be content by following overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deﬁnition I (Initial State). The initial state is as follows according to the superposition principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|s\\rangle = |+\\rangle ^ {\\bigotimes n} = H^{\\bigotimes n} |0\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "if $z \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ be the bit string then $|s\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2^n} \\sum_z|z\\rangle $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Definition II (Objective Function). In a combinatorial optimization problem deﬁned on n-bit binary strings z, the objective function is deﬁned as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(z): \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow R$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Definition III (Phase Operators). We can map the objective function, Definition I, to the phase Hamiltonian, thus ﬁnding the optimal value of the objective function is a special case of ﬁnding the extremal eigenvalues for the phase Hamiltonian. The phase Hamiltonian $H_{P}$ has eigenvalues that are the cost function for corresponding eigenstates. it acts diagonally on the computational basis states of $2^{n}$ dimensional Hilbert space (n-qubit space).\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_p|z\\rangle = f(z)|z\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the phase operators is unitary with $\\gamma$ parameter. This parameter is angle $\\phi$ in the circuit implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$U_p(\\gamma) = \\exp{(-i\\gamma H_p)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Definition IV (Mixing Operators). The mixing Hamiltonian H M is deﬁned as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_M = \\sum^{n}_{j=1} \\sigma^{x}_{j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma^{x}$ is the Pauli-X operator, it's usually used for bit flip operation. Similar to the phase operator, the mixing operator is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$U_M (\\beta) = \\exp{(-i\\beta H_M)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Based on these QAOA breakdown,</b> the quantum state can be represented by two numbers (parameters) $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$. Say, there are p number of qubits in the problem then the circuit will have 2p number of parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Max-Cut \n",
    "There are plethora of studies providing different formulation for the tid-bits like Objective function, Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC), and Optimization. Refer to Section II, \"Building blocks of variational quantum algorithms\" in the reference enlisted at [1]. However, for the Max-Cut problem things need not to be overly complicated. The primary reference [8] that I followed shows a straightforward way to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to express the Max-Cut problem. I have chosen to put it as following from the Wikipedia on MaxCut. The graphs I have dealt in this notebook are unwieghted, if otherwise then the weights are calculated into the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For a graph, a maximum cut is a cut whose size is at least the size of any other cut\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is the \"cut\" counted? Consider a graph with m edges and n vertices. We seek the partition z of the vertices into two sets A and B which maximizes \n",
    "\n",
    "$C(z) = \\sum^{m}_{\\alpha = 1}C_{\\alpha}(z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{\\alpha}(z) = 1$ if z places one vertex from the $\\alpha^{th}$ edge in set A and the other in set B. The vertices resides on either set A or set B so this welcomes qubits. Likewise, the qubit takes either 0 or 1 bitstring values. The vertice that is in A is 0 and in the other case is 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a visualization let's checkout the graph with maximum cut. The graph is taken from the [pennylane tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_maxcut.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/images/graph.png\" alt=\"Maximum cut graph\" width=\"250\"/>\n",
    "<figcaption><b>Figure 1 - A maximally cut graph.</b></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Straight out of the box, the bitstring representing the graph is $|0101\\rangle$ since the two vertices belongs to A and the other two belongs to B."
