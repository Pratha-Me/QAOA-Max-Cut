# QAOA-Max-Cut

I solved the most studied problem of Combinatorial optimization, namely, MaxCut by using QAOA. In the python notebook, I have gone through a light leterature review and then build the codes. I have solved two cases of graph, albeit, both are four nodes. The results are accurate in both of the cases. 

I have enlisted the all references in at the end of the notebook. To generate this report my two primary resources to study are bulleted below.
